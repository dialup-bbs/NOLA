This is a Schism Tracker (.it) jungle / drum & bass / drumfunk track written at about 151 bpm. Lots of original samples for you to rip - 48k 24-bit. Reason the file is so large. 

Original live Rhodes, dark atmospherics, DIY-analog 808 bass+Fuzz Face samples and breakbeat processing by Dialup BBS.

Very dark vibes inside.
